This is a very simple GitHub action that allows you to deploy to Heroku. The action works by running the following commands in shell via NodeJS:-

# Working

```bash
# This will create and write to a file called .netrc
# Some useful Stackoverflow answers pointed out that heroku
# checks this file for the username and password during login
# So writing to it beforehand will allow us to bypass the annoying
# open browser to login part of the heroku login
cat >~/.netrc <<EOF
machine api.heroku.com
    login ${email}
    password ${api_key}
machine git.heroku.com
    login ${email}
    password ${api_key}
EOF

heroku login
# If usedocker is set to true, then additionally the below command is run
# >heroku container:login

# The APPNAME needs to be passed via the Action
heroku git:remote --app APP_NAME
# if the above command fails, then the action will run
# >heroku create APP_NAME
# if a buildpack was specified in the action, then it will run
# >heroku create APP_NAME --buildpack BUILDPACK

# The BRANCH can be passed via the Action. If not passed, it defaults to 'HEAD'
git push heroku BRANCH:refs/heads/master
# if the above command fails, then the action will run
# >git push heroku BRANCH:refs/heads/master --force
# This is to ensure that your app gets updated should you choose to update from a different branch that is behind your current one
# But this might not be convenient for you in which case, you can switch off the behaviour by setting dontuseforce to true

# The following scenario takes place if the usedocker flag is set to true
# instead of git push heroku BRANCH:refs/heads/master
# The below commands are run
# >heroku container:push web --app APP_NAME
# >heroku container:release web --app APP_NAME
```

# Usage

In order to use the action in your workflow, just add in your _.github/workflows/YOURACTION.yml_

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.0.2 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}
          heroku_app_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          buildpack: "SOME BUILDPACK" #OPTIONAL
          branch: "YOUR_BRANCH" #OPTIONAL and DEFAULT - 'HEAD' (a.k.a your current branch)
          dontuseforce: false #OPTIONAL and DEFAULT - false
          usedocker: false #OPTIONAL and DEFAULT - false
          appdir: "" #OPTIONAL and DEFAULT - "". This is useful if the api you're deploying is in a subfolder
          docker_heroku_process_type: "" #OPTIONAL and DEFAULT - "web"
```

Note. Thanks to [meszarosdezso](https://github.com/meszarosdezso) for adding the appdir feature

Note. The **docker_heroku_process_type** is used to dictate the type of heroku process to use (Ex: web, worker) and it is only useful if **usedocker** is set to true. Thanks to [singleton11](https://github.com/singleton11) for adding this feature.

You can if you want pass the heroku_app_name, heroku_email and buildpack through github secrets as well if you want, just make sure that atleast your heroku_api_key is passed via GitHub Secrets.

# Using Docker

Heroku now allows users to deploy docker containers. To use this feature, simply add a Dockerfile to your project and add a `CMD` command at the end of the Dockerfile. This is the command used by heroku to start the webserver inside the container. Finally make sure to set the `usedocker` flag to true before deploying.

P.S: Keep in mind that if you deploy once using docker, the same heroku app is not compatible with a non-docker setup and similarly, you cannot deploy a dockerized setup to a non-docker heroku app.

Also thanks to [Olav Sundf√∏r](https://github.com/olaven) for adding this feature

# Important Notes

- You can find the secrets tab in your project's settings

- Be careful with your appname, cuz the action either deploys to an existing app or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. So if you accidently change it after deploying it once already, the action won't fail, it'll just create a new dyno and if you are on a paid plan, heroku can be expensive. On that note, always check the logs of your actions to make sure everything is A-OK.

- If you're using the above exact workflow code, keep in mind that it deploys whenever you make a change to the master branch (Even README updates which have nothing to do with application code) and that might not be very efficient for you, have a look through the github actions docs to customize when the action should trigger.

  (I would recommend making a separate dev branch and setting up the action to trigger upon pull request to the master branch)

- By default, if you don't specify a branch in your action, it will default to the HEAD branch (or whichever branch the action is defined under). So you might be wondering what happens if you define the same action in a different branch under the same heroku app name (or which you try to deploy to the same appname from a different branch)? The answer is that the new branch overrides whatever your old branch was (even if the new branch is behind the old branch in terms of commits unless you set dontuseforce to true)
